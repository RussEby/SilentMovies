# Silent Films

Using links of Silent from stored on Internet Archive, this example of a Svelte app allows the user to view the movies in the browser.

## CodeSandbox

While this code doesn't require CodeSandbox to use the code, I did use CodeSandbox to create and make updates, so it'll run fine.

## Svelte

I'm adding new features to the app as I explore the Svelte framework. This may make the app a little mix matched in features or styles, but it's a learning process.

## Internet Archive

Internet Archive has tons of movies, audio, books, and games. If you find it useful, please think about supporting the incredible work they do.
